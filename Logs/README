All the logs sent by the logger calls will be written to 'debug.log' this folder.

How to log in a file:
----------------------------
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# A simple string logged at the "warning" level
logger.warning("Your log message is here")

# A string with a variable at the "info" level
logger.info("The value of var is %s", var)

    warning: Info that could be problematic, but is non-urgent.
    error: Info that is important and likely requires prompt attention.
    critical: If you need one higher than error, here it is
